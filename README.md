# Miniproject_4

## Tasks:

1. Load the dataset transaction_data.csv.
2. Check the table's size, variable types, the number of missing values, and descriptive statistics.
3. Identify the values in the 'transaction' column and count how many observations belong to each level. Visualize the results using a bar plot and consider how to improve the chart.
4. Determine how many transactions ended in an error.
5. Calculate the number of successful transactions for each user and create a histogram to show the distribution of the number of successful transactions.
6. Your colleague sent you updated data. Create a pivot table called user_vs_minute_pivot where user names are columns, minutes are rows, and the values represent the number of operations in a given minute. Fill missing values with zeros.
7. Analyze the graph presented by your colleague. Help them determine if there is an error in the data or if everything is fine. If there is an error, correct it and save the correct number of minutes that have passed since the beginning of the day in the 'true_minute' column.
